#+title: NFTAMM

* Overview
NFTAMM is a system that allows people to fungitize their NFTs, and trade these voucherables in an AMM.

This allows for an easily determinable floor for people to use.

* Architecture
*** Exhibition
Exhibition is vault system that allows NFT owners to deposit their NFTs into an exhibit (an account that relates to a single collection).

Every time a user deposits their NFT, they get a voucher token they can then trade for SOL in the Bazaar
*** Bazaar
Bazaar is a AMM contract a trading stand (a trading pool) for an exhibit's voucher tokens, and WSOL.

The Bazaar has 3 functions, Swap, Deposit Liquidity, and Withdraw Liquidity for users to interact with the stand, and an Instantiate Stand function for the exhibit creator to start a market for their collection
*** Checkout
The next stage of the project was to implement a floor bid system, where bidders can place limit buy orders, and sellers can instant sell into these bids.

This involved storing using commited SOL for buy orders in a heap data structure, allowing functionallity for a seller to come market sell to a buyer, and the buyer being able to come redeem their newly acquired nft
*** Semiswap


** Floor bid

This will consist of the *Cantina* and *Checkout*
*** Cantina
this contract allows bidders to place orders, where they deposit sol into the contract, as well as cancel orders and receive their sol back

* Deploy script
the test folder has a full workflow of interacting with the exhibition and bazaar contracts

the deploy/testnet.ts is a script adapting features from the test files to start a new local-test-validator with the relavent data for easy network bootstrapping
* TODO
** select multiple nfts at once
** better check of creators in exhibition and nft
